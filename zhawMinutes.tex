\textbf{Present:} Stephan Neuhaus, Raphael Emberger

\section{Initiation}\label{sec:Initiation}
The meeting took place on the \textit{Friday, 26th of April 2019, 13:00} in \textit{ZL0.13, Lagerstrasse 45, Zürich}. Raphael Emberger was resonsible for the minutes.

\section{Points of discussion}
\subsection{Login and shell usage}
The remote login, starting and usage of a user shell works now. It still does not behave like intended, as there are warnings printed on the screen and every line written gets echoed back, but overall, it works.

\subsection{Pty echoes \texttt{stdin} back to \texttt{stdout} on client}
As described in the point above, when entering shell commands on the shell after remote login, the written lines gets echoed back after hitting enter.
\paragraph{Solution}
The reason this was so, is because the terminal on the client was still in the \textit{cooked} mode rather than the \textit{raw} mode, which behaves differently from the default \textit{cooked} mode, which read line by line and catches and interprets signals like \texttt{[Ctrl]+[C]} or \texttt{[Ctrl]+[D]}. Setting the terminal into \textit{raw} mode should solve the issue as explained in "The Linux Programming Interface".

\subsection{Transfer of \texttt{SIGWINCH}/\texttt{ioctl}}
As described in the first point of discussion, when dropping into the remote shell, there are warnings displayed about a problem with \texttt{ioctl}.
\paragraph{Solution}
In "The Linux Programming Interface" it is also mentioned that making the child the session leader would solve this issue.

\subsection{Login with test user fails}
Trying to login with the test user results in an error when starting the shell because of missing files.
\paragraph{Solution}
This issue was easily solved as the script for setting up the test user was faulty: It didn't properly create the home directory of the test user and since the process which dropped privilege after login didn't have root rights anymore, it couldn't enter the home directory. Therefore, the directory owner and permissions were amended.

\subsection{Forking abandoned}
3.4 of the last meeting suggested using the C-style sockets to pass the file descriptors to the child process, which should solve the issue with forking and still using the \texttt{net.Conn} object. This has been implemented and after some adjustment worked out well.

\section{Old Business}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Login attempts in Linux fail} This problem was deemed lower priority, as Login works on the WSL and can still be dealt with in later stages of the project.
\end{itemize}
