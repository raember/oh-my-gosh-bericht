\textbf{Present:} Stephan Neuhaus, Raphael Emberger

\section{Initiation}\label{sec:Initiation}
The meeting took place on the \textit{Friday, 10th of May 2019, 12:20} in \textit{ZL0.13, Lagerstrasse 45, Zürich}. Raphael Emberger was resonsible for the minutes.

\section{Points of discussion}
\subsection{File descriptors and Go}
After resolving last weeks issue with \texttt{SockAddr}(3.2), the same approach enabled us to get the fd of a connection: By type-asserting it as \texttt{*net.TCPConn}, which had a function that returns the underlying file, which in turn had a function for returning the underlying fd.

\subsection{Privilege dropping}
After authenticating the user via keys, the host process spawns a shell with the appropriate privileges. For more secure handling, it was deemed best to drop privilege for the entire host process after authenticating via keys. Despite running with root rights(to enable a user to login as any user), the process receives an exception when calling \texttt{unix.Setuid} or \texttt{unix.Setgid}. The reason was assumed to be related to Go's infamous Go-routines.

\subsection{Current State of Documentation}
The current state of the documentation is still insufficient. There are 4 weeks until the deadline. It is suggested to write more on the documentation.
