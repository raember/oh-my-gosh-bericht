\section{Attendees}\label{sec:Attandees}
\textbf{Present:} Stephan Neuhaus, Raphael Emberger

\section{Initiation}\label{sec:Initiation}
The meeting took place on the \textit{Friday, 31th of May 2019, 12:30} in \textit{ZL0.13, Lagerstrasse 45, Zürich}. Raphael Emberger was responsible for the minutes.

\section{Points of discussion}
\subsection{Time Issues}
Because of the lack of participation from a peer, Raphael was occupied with the labs of the AI2 course for over two days, which led to more pressure in finishing the thesis.

\subsection{Project stopped working}
When connecting to the server, the host application cannot open the connection from the file descriptor and throws a "Bad file-descriptor" error. This happens on the WSL.

Using a native Linux distribution solved this issue.

\subsection{Formal Requirements}
It was stressed to find out more about the formal requirements, lest the whole thesis might face tribulations due to formal details.

\subsection{Attendance of Mr. Schwarz at the Presentation}
It was suggested to include Mr. Schwarz in the presentation of the thesis as he was part of the team for a considerable amount of time. He has no obligation to present himself but may attend the presentation itself.

\section*{Next Meeting}
There will not be any further meetings.
