\section{Attendees}\label{sec:Attandees}
\textbf{Present:} Stephan Neuhaus, Raphael Emberger\\
\textbf{Absent:} Kevin Schwarz\textit{(illness)}

\section{Initiation}\label{sec:Initiation}
The meeting took place on the \textit{Friday, 5th of April 2019, 13:00} in \textit{ZL0.13, Lagerstrasse 45, Zürich}. Raphael Emberger was resonsible for the minutes.

\section{Points of discussion}
\subsection{Process forking unsuccessful}
Attempts on forking a sub-process were unsuccessful. The reason for this was that the standard
library of Go doesn’t allow such mechanics, as Go was designed with go-routines in mind instead.
\paragraph{Solution}
A quick test with cgo yielded a viable solution to the problem: Using the C-routine \texttt{fork()} a fork was successful.

\subsection{Shell instantiating and forwarding}
Attempts in forwarding the client connection to a server-side shell's \texttt{stdin} and its \texttt{stdout} and \texttt{stderr} to the connection of the client were unsuccessful.
\paragraph{Solution}
One quick tests showed that hooking up the \texttt{std*} pipes to a local shell process with Go worked just fine. Therefore it was deemed feasible to transfer the entire interface to the client.

\subsection{Participation of Mr. Schwarz}
Up until this date, the participation of Mr Schwarz was remarkable little in terms of writing on the code base of the project. The present parties agreed on this matter.
\paragraph{Solution}
It was decided to give Mr Schwarz a choice of action: Either he starts to participate heavily in the project from now on or he opts out of the project entirely.

\section{Old Business}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Login attempts in Linux fail: } This problem was deemed lower priority, as Login works
on the WSL and can still be dealt with in later stages of the project.
\end{itemize}
